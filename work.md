## **‚öôÔ∏è Technical Requirements**

### **Required Stack**

- **Development**: Must use Cursor
- **Language**: Python or TypeScript
- **LLM**: Any (OpenAI, Claude, etc.)
- **Data Storage**: Minimal (PostgreSQL, SQLite, or even JSON)

### **Required Features**

```python
# 1. Job Input
job_description = "Senior Backend Engineer at fintech startup..."

# 2. Candidate Discovery
candidates = agent.search_linkedin(job_description)
# Returns: [{"name": "John Doe", "linkedin_url": "...", "headline": "..."}]

# 3. Fit Scoring
scored_candidates = agent.score_candidates(candidates, job_description)
# Returns: [{"name": "...", "score": 8.5, "breakdown": {...}}]

# 4. Message Generation
messages = agent.generate_outreach(scored_candidates[:5], job_description)
# Returns: [{"candidate": "...", "message": "Hi John, I noticed..."}]

```
